## General

- **Result from a job imported in a new document**: If a result from one of your
  jobs is received while you have a modal opened (be it from alpaca or
  photoshop), this will cause an error in Photoshop and leave a new document
  opened. For now, you can either wait for the results to be received before
  opening modals, or just manually close the new document. We are working on a
  fix to wait until there is no modal opened before loading the result.

## Inpainting & Transfer

- **Could not complete your request because the selected area is empty**: If
  some corners of your selection are outside the canvas, you will get this error
  as many times as there are corners outside ðŸ¤— This is caused by processing
  that alpaca must do before sending the request to the backed, we are working
  on a fix to remove the errors.
- **Fill & Transfer slower than Imagine**: In order to do inpainting or
  transfer, the model must see what is in your selection area to predict
  something coherent. This means an image will be uploaded for processing. In
  the worst case, that image can be up to ~3MB if you are selecting a complex
  1024x1024 image. If your connection is slow that can take some amount of time
  to upload. Imagine only needs your prompt and as such requires much less data
  to be uploaded.
- **Black or White results with Transfer**: This happens when you are using the
  Transfer feature while having a selection that is partly or entirely
  transparent. Transparent pixels will be converted to either black or white by
  the model before processing and thus the result will be heavily influenced by
  those pixels. Currently, the best way to deal with this is to first fill the
  transparent zone, either with Inpaint or yourself, and then Transfer. We are
  working on allowing you to Transfer incomplete selections directly.
