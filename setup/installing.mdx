title: "Installing the Beta Plugin"
---

## Prerequisite

- Photoshop must be installed **and up to date**. Ensure you have at least
  version 23.0.
  - We will be working on making the plugin work for any version greater than
    22.0 in the future, but for now you will likely encounter issues if you are
    not up to date.

## Downloading the plugin

You'll find the download link directly in your
[Dashboard](https://accounts.getalpaca.io/sign-in?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getalpaca.io%2Fdashboard).

## Installation

### With Creative Cloud

1. Simply click on the file you downloaded (**alpaca.ccx**). This should open
   Creative Cloud and ask you if want to install the plugin locally.

<Note>
  If nothing happens when you double click on the file, quit Creative Cloud
  before trying to open the file again.
</Note>

2. Once installed, open **Photoshop**, and you should see a new tab called
   'alpaca' with a login screen. You can dock this tab anywhere just like any
   other Photoshop tab.

<Note>
  If you do not see the tab, in Photoshop, go to **Plugins → alpaca** and make
  sure alpaca is checked.
</Note>

### Without Creative Cloud

1. Unzip alpaca.zip, you should now have a alpaca folder (with a version number
   in the name)
2. Move the alpaca folder in your Photoshop plugin directory
   1. On MacOS, the plugin folder is located under **Applications → Adobe
      Photoshop 2022 → Plug-ins**
   2. On Windows, the plugin folder should be under **C:/ Program Files/ Common
      Files/ Adobe/ Plug-ins/CC**

3. Open Photoshop (if it was already open, restart it), in the menu, under
   **Plugins** you should now see **alpaca**. Enable it by clicking on **alpaca
   → alpaca**. Going back into Photoshop, you should now see an **alpaca** tab,
   you can move it or dock it anywhere and start using **alpaca**.
