[Dashboard](https://accounts.getalpaca.io/sign-in?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getalpaca.io%2Fdashboard) by following the 3-step guide.

## Installation

### With Creative Cloud

1. Simply click on the file you downloaded (e.g. `alpaca-1.5.1_PS23.ccx`). This should open
   Creative Cloud and ask you if want to install the plugin locally.

<Note>
  If nothing happens when you double click on the file, quit Creative Cloud
  before trying to open the file again.
</Note>

2. Once installed, open **Photoshop**, and you should see a new tab called
   'alpaca' with a login screen. You can dock this tab anywhere just like any
   other Photoshop tab.

<Note>
  If you do not see the tab, in Photoshop, go to **Plugins → alpaca** and make
  sure alpaca is checked.
</Note>

### Without Creative Cloud

1. Unzip (e.g. `alpaca-1.5.1_PS23.zip`), you should now have a alpaca folder (with a version number
   in the name)
2. Move the alpaca folder in your Photoshop plugin directory
   1. On MacOS, the plugin folder is located under **Applications → Adobe
      Photoshop 2022 → Plug-ins**
   2. On Windows, the plugin folder should be under **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2022\Plug-ins**

   **Plugins** you should now see **alpaca**. Enable it by clicking on **alpaca
   → alpaca**. Going back into Photoshop, you should now see an **alpaca** tab,
   you can move it or dock it anywhere and start using **alpaca**.
