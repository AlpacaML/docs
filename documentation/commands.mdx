## Imagine

Simply enter a prompt and alpaca will output an image matching it. You can play
with the various settings (modifiers, number of steps, guidance scale and seed)
to get different results.

## Fill

Fill will try to fill any transparent pixel in your selection with something
that is both coherent with the non-transparent pixels, and with the prompt you
sent.

To use it, first select the area to fill with Photoshop's “Marquee Tool" (M) and
click on Fill.

<Warning>
  Be careful to have the right layers selected. When you select an area, you
  might not actually have selected what you see if you have multiple layers.
  alpaca will only use pixels that are in the selection and in the currently
  active layer.
</Warning>

## Transfer

Given a prompt and a selection, **Transfer** will try to match the prompt, while
keeping the main features that were present in the selection originally.

To use it, first select the area to transfer with Photoshop's “Marquee Tool" (M)
and click on **Transfer**.
