## Imagine

Simply enter a prompt and alpaca will output an image matching it. You can play with the various settings to get different results.

## Fill

Fill will try to fill any transparent pixel in your selection with something
that is both coherent with the non-transparent pixels, and with the prompt you
sent.

To use it, first select the area to fill with Photoshop's â€œMarquee Tool" (M) and
click on Fill.

<Warning>
  Be careful to have the right layers selected. When you select an area, you
  might not actually have selected what you see if you have multiple layers.
  alpaca will only use pixels that are in the selection and in the currently
  active layer.
</Warning>

## Transfer

Given a prompt and a selection, **Transfer** will try to match the prompt, while
keeping the main features that were present in the selection originally.

To use it, first select the area to transfer with Photoshop's **Marquee** tool (M)
and click on **Transfer**.

<Tip>
Adjust the Transfer Strength to get the result you want: The closer the result you want to achieve is to the original image, the lower you should set the Transfer Strength. Inversly, the more you want the model to modify the image, the higher you should set it
