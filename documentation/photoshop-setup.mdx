## Document size and transparent background

For now every image generated by **alpaca** will be 1024x1024 pixels. Thus, you
should not create a document smaller than that.

Also, since **alpaca** will use transparency as mask for inpainting, you should
start with a document that has a transparent background.

You can easily set the right parameters (and save them for later) by going to
"File → New”

## Presetting the Marquee tool to the right size

Any image you use as initialization for inpainting or transfer will be resized
(not cropped) to be a squared image before being sent to the model. If your
selection is not a square, you might get distortion in the result. To make
selections of the correct size easily, simply create a preset for the Marquee
Tool in Photoshop of 1024x1024 pixel, that you can then use every time.
