## Managing layers with alpaca

Every action in **alpaca** will result in a new layer being created with the
result of your query. This is both to allow you to discard bad results, but also
to be able to blend a result with previous layers.

Every layer created by **alpaca** should have its corresponding prompt as name.

If you see layers with names such as `alpaca_12345`, do not worry, those are
layers used internally by alpaca to pre-process your selections for inpainting
or transfer. They should be automatically deleted once the processing is
finished.
