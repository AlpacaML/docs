## Template

Templates are pre-made combinations of prompts and modifiers allowing you to
quickly see a few different examples if you are new to diffusion models.

## Image Size

Controls the size of the generated images. Note that you can only change this
parameter for **Imagine**. For other types of jobs, the size of the generated
images is controlled by the size of the selected area in Photoshop.

## Prompt

Every output from Alpaca starts with a “prompt”, a textual description of the
desired output. For example:

```yaml
prompt: a house on hill
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-1.png" />

A prompt can be as simple or as complex as you like. Detailed prompts tend to
produce better results.

Finding a good prompt that matches what we want is not always easy, especially
for newcomers to the world of diffusion models. To make the process of finding
good prompts easier, there are tools such as [Lexica](https://lexica.art/) to
see example of prompts and the kind of result you can expect by using them.

Note that using the same prompt as an online example, will not generate the same
image. More on that in the **seed** section.

You can also decide to not use a prompt, by leaving this box empty. The model
will then generate a result unguided.

## Number of Images

We can specify the number of images we wish to generate from a particular prompt
and set of modifiers.

Each image will be different.

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-2.png" />

Once your image has been generated, you will see the following appear in the
Jobs panel. The arrows will allow you to toggle through the set of generated
images. The check will allow you to select your current image and discard all
others. The cross will discard **all** generated images.

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-3.png" />

## Modifiers

`Modifiers` allow you to automatically modify a prompt by adding attributes or
qualities to it.

This is helpful to freeze part of a prompt once you found something you like so
that you do not have to retype everything all the time.

A modifiers is composed of two parts: the text and the weight. The text simply
describe the attribute you want to save, and can be as long as you want.

The weight describes how strong that attribute should be, the bigger the weight,
the more your prompt will be skewed toward it.

Modifiers are stored in the format `<text>::<weight>`, for example:

```yaml
modifiers:
	manga::3
	anime::1
	drawing::1
```

We can generate variations on our basic house example from above by adding in
some modifiers.

```yaml
modifiers:
	monet::2
	watercolor::1
	sunrise::1
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-4.png" />

```yaml
modifiers:
	simpsons::2
	animation::1
	forest::1
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-5.png" />

```yaml
modifiers:
	art deco::1
	modernist::1
	photograph::1
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-6.png" />

## Seed

The seed is an integer value that is the source of randomness in the model. Each
image By varying the seed, we can generate different images from the same prompt
and set of modifiers.

On the other hand, generating twice with the same set of prompt, modifiers &
seed will generate the exact same result twice.

You can leave the prompt to 0 if you just want the model to use a random seed
everytime.

```yaml
prompt: a house on a hill
modifiers:
	studio ghibli::2
seed: 1
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-7.png" />

```yaml
prompt: a house on a hill
modifiers:
	studio ghibli::2
seed: 24
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-7b.png" />

Because the seed is responsible for the random noise that the model will then
use as a starting point to generate images, using the same seed, even when
varying prompts and modifiers will result in images that have the same
qualities, such as the general color palette, placement of objects etc. You can
use this fact to your advantage to increase the coherency of different
generations.

## Quality

This controls the number of diffusion steps that carry us from the original
source noise to the final image. By increasing the number of steps, we generally
improve the quality of the result and it’s correlation with the prompt and
modifiers.

## Prompt Strength

The prompt strength controls the influence of the prompt — higher values of this
parameter force the model to be more attentive to the prompt. We can consider
this to be a “rigid” vs “relaxed” interpretation of the prompt.

```yaml
prompt: a house on a hill
modifiers:
	disney::2
	animation::1
seed: 1
prompt strength: 2
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-9.png" />

```yaml
prompt: a house on a hill
modifiers:
	disney::2
	animation::1
seed: 1
prompt strength: 11
```

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="/images/parameters-10.png" />

## Transfer Strength

<Note>Only applies to **Transfer**</Note>

The transfer strength controls how much we want to modify the input image. High
transfer strength will modify the input image strongly, resulting in an image
that may not have much relation with the input anymore. While a very low
strength will not leave enough time for the model to make any noticeable changes
to the image.

A balanced strength, will keep the main features of the input image alive while
modifying it enough so that it becomes closer to your prompt
