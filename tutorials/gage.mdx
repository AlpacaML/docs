## Introduction

Here is some text that describes what this tutorial is at a high-level.

## Getting Started 

The beginning of any project is pretty standard - I settle on a rough idea of 
what kind of piece I want to create and spend some time experimenting with prompts and modifiers. 
Once I've locked in my list I generate a dozen or so images to start with. 
The two things I'm looking out for are interesting shape 
language and good composition. I note interesting color 
palettes, but it's not a high priority.

Once I've got a good batch I pick a small handful of 
my favorites and arrange them on a canvas. At this point 
I usually have a good idea as to which I'd like to start 
with as my base.

## Working with Adjustment Layers

At this point I immediately add a black & white 
adjustment layer and keep it on for the majority of 
the process. I want to focus on establishing strong
 shapes and interesting textures, and adjust the 
 levels of each layer to make sure the values in the 
 final piece cohere nicely.

 From here I start cutting different pieces from my 
 sample images and arranging them, focusing on large 
 shapes. Each layer is blended using a mask, often 
 merging them together and using the clone stamp and 
 paint brush wherever I feel like I need to touch things up.

## Adding Detail and Texture with Transfer
As I get close to finishing the compositing stage, 
I'll get rid of the surrounding canvas, merge my 
arrangement layers, and start making liberal use of 
the Transfer tool. I'll go through each part of the 
piece and run anywhere between 5 and 10 transfers 
on each area to generate the layers that I'll use to 
paint in the fine details & textures using the same 
masking technique mentioned before, as well as another l
ow-strength Transfer pass to "glue" things together if 
necessary. This is the most time-intensive part of the 
process, but where most of the magic really happens.


## Post-Processing
Once I'm happy with the final detail pass I'll delete the 
black & white adjustment, save a copy, then flatten my project. 
From here I use more conventional post-processing techniques.
I start adding adjustment layers to fine tune my levels, curves, colors, etc. 

Finally, I'll add clouds and paint in changes to light & color in places 
I think need an extra bit of attention and sometimes slap on a subtle 
vignette if I'm feeling fancy.
