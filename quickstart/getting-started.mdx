In this tutorial, we will cover the **Imagine**, **Outpaint**, **Inpaint**, and **Transfer** functions, as well as a few key Photoshop tips to help everything work smoothly.

<Warning>
Note that the videos you will find throughout this tutorial have been 
accelerated to keep them short, they do not reflect the actual time it 
takes to generate images.
</Warning>

### Opening up a new project file

First, we'll want to create a new project file inside Photoshop. 
You can choose any size canvas you like.

### Generating an image using *Imagine*

Now that we've selected our canvas size, we're ready to generate 
our first image. We can do this by first clicking the **Imagine** button 
on the Alpaca panel, which should produce a pop-up box like the following:

<figure>
  <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      height="400"
      width="400"
      src="/images/imagine_popup.png"
      alt="The Alpaca Imagine pop-up"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>The Alpaca Imagine pop-up box</figcaption>
</figure>

Here, we can get started using one of the Alpaca templates to determine
the style of our output images. Let's click the drop-down menus labeled `Template`
and select the option `Manga`. We'll cover creating custom templates later in the
**Configuring global settings** section of the guide. 

Next, we can input a text prompt to Alpaca. Let's try the prompt `A country house`. 

You can generate between 1-5 images per text prompt. It's usually better 
to generate many images, since the style and quality can vary for each generation.

      alt="Generating an image with the Alpaca Imagine function."
    />

By default, **Imagine** will generate a square image and put it 
in the top left corner of your canvas. 

However you can also tell Alpaca what size of image you want, 
and where you want it by making a selection before clicking on Imagine.

To do that, we’ll want to use Photoshop’s Marquee (shortcut M) tool 
to identify the region within which we want to generate our image. 

<Warning>
We’ll want to keep the aspect ratio of this region less than 2:1 
(i.e. the larger size of your selection must not be more than twice 
the smaller size), and no more than 1024x1024 pixels in area.
</Warning>

### Extending an image using *Fill*

We can extend (or *outpaint*) an existing image using using 
the **Fill** function. 

We'll want to use the **Marquee** tool to identify the empty space we want
to outpaint. We can think of the parts of the existing image we include in
the **Marquee** square as "extra information" that Alpaca will use to extend
the image. Additionally, we'll want to prompt Alpaca by
describing the what we would like to see in the outpainted section, in this
case, let's try `a small pond in front of a house`.

<Warning>
Do make sure that you have the correct layer selected when you use Fill, 
as only the pixels from that layer will be used as context.

If you are new to Photoshop, an easy way to make sure you have the 
correct layer selected is to simply merge all visible layers before 
using Fill (you can do this by hitting `Command` + `shift` + `e`). 
This will ensure that whatever you see on the screen is what the model 
will also receive.
</Warning>

### Inpainting an image using *Fill*

**Fill** can laso be used to change details of an image, amd to remove/replace
existing objects (also called *inpainting*). 

We can use Photoshop's Erase tool (shortcut `E`) to remove an existing object 
or to indicate where we would like to draw in a new one, then use the **Fill** 
function to fill in the empty space however we would like. In this example, 
let's erase out a section a section in front of the house and inpaint a car 
parked on the driveway using the prompt `a car parked in front of a house`.

<Warning>
Do make sure that you have the correct layer selected when you use **Fill**, 
as only the pixels from that layer will be used as context.

If you are new to Photoshop, an easy way to make sure you have the correct 
layer selected is to simply merge all visible layers before using Fill 
(you can do this by hitting `Command`+ `shift` + `e`). This will ensure that 
whatever you see on the screen is what the model will also receive.
</Warning>

### Transforming objects using *Transfer*

Transfer (also called image-to-image) is a great tool to 
transform parts of an image.

The Transfer function will generate a new layer in the shape of whatever 
we have selected using the Marquee tool. To blend things nicely, we can 
erase around the object using the Erase tool to reveal the previous
layer and then merge all layers together when we’re happy with the result. 
A faster way to do this is to use Photoshop’s **Object Selection Tool**
(shortcut `W``) to automatically select our new object, we can then right 
click on the object and choose Select Inverse to automatically select the 
surrounding context and delete it.

    />

**Transfer** can also be used generate variations of an image, 
change the style of an image or even turn a quick sketch into a 
beautiful picture.

Here, we’ll change an image of a corgi into a funkier cyberpunk version. 
Again, we can use **Marquee** to select parts of the image that 
we would like to transform (in this case, our entire canvas).

      type="video/mp4"
    />

### Settings

Once you’re comfortable with the basic features of Alpaca, 
you can create your own custom templates in the **Settings** panel. 

Click on the gear icon on the right side of the Alpaca window to 
open up the **Settings** panel. Here, we can select some **modifiers**, 
which describe the style we are trying to achieve. We can assign 
**weights** to our modifiers (must be integers) that tell Alpaca how 
much we want each modifier to contribute to the style of the outputs.

If you like, you can copy our example modifiers into your project settings:
