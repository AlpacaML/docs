  Make sure you followed the section [Correctly Setting up Photoshop for
  alpaca](/guides/documentation/photoshop-setup) in first.

## General

- Make use of Photoshop's â€œObject selection tool" (W) to quickly extract
  specific items from a generation.

## Imagine

- **Keeping style consistent**: Once you have found a combination of prompt and
  seed that give you a result that you like, you can "freeze" them in the
  settings. Extract the constant part from your prompt (e.g "octane render") and
  store them as modifiers in the settings (see - Modifiers if you don't know how
  to do that). The seed can also be fixed in the settings. Once fixed that seed
  will be used for every future command.

## Fil

- **Removing hard edges**: If the selection you want to fill contains hard edges
  (e.g. the edge of a previous generation), and you get bad results with a
  subsequent Fill. You will get better results if you first smooth the hard
  edges, you can use Photoshop's eraser with a very low hardness (less than
  30%).

## Transfer

- **Adding texture**: If you draw something with very little texture (for
  example using the bucket), the model will tend to generate something with very
  little details as well. You can either add more details to your image, or you
  can use Photoshop tools like "smudge" to automatically add more texture.
